todo
====

My todo app is complete. This app creates a simple Todo list and allows for modification and deletion of todo items. The items are persisted in a text file.

Time spent: 4hrs (including installation)

Second Submissions:

1) The app now allows storing a due date for each todo item.
2) The items are persisted in a SQLite database.

Next steps:
1) The UI is clunky, work on showing date as subtext.
2) Add priority for each todo item and reflect it in UI
3) Possibly set alerts as due date gets closer.
